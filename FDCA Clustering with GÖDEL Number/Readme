# Avg and Median Method Clustering

This repository implements clustering using the average and median methods. The code allows flexibility for updating the dataset, adjusting clustering parameters, and fine-tuning the algorithm based on the dataset.

 Steps to Update and Run

 1. Update the Cell Length
  - The cell length determines how the feature values are encoded. 
  - You can update the cell length by modifying the configuration file or directly within the script where the 
     encoding function is defined. 
  - Make sure that the updated cell length is suitable for the dataset and does not cause overflow or underflow in 
     the encoding process.

 2. Update the .csv File
   - Download the latest dataset in `.csv` format.
   - Replace the old `.csv` file in the repository or update the file path in the script accordingly. 
   - Ensure that the dataset includes all required columns, and the new `.csv` file is consistent with the expected 
     format.

 3. Preprocess the Dataset
   - The dataset needs to be preprocessed to remove non-essential columns and scale/normalize the attributes.
   - Generate G{\"o}del numbers: Once the attributes are scaled, they will be encoded using the G{\"o}del  
    numbering scheme.

 4. Change the Store Location
   - Update the directory or file path where the results will be stored after running the clustering algorithm.

 5. Adjust Iterations
   - The number of iterations can be increased or decreased depending on the dataset's size and the desired    
     precision of the clustering results.
   - Modify the `iterations` variable or related parameter in the code to control how many iterations the algorithm 
     should run.

 6. Run the Clustering Algorithm
   - Once the above steps are completed, run the clustering algorithm using the avg and median methods.
   - You can execute the code using Python by running:
     ```bash
     python3 clustering_script.py
     ```

 7. Evaluate the Results
   - After running the clustering algorithm, review the results and make sure the output file is stored at the correct 
     location.
