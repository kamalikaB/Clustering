## Clustering using Reversible Cellular Automata
The ![Clustering]([URL](https://github.com/kamalikaB/Clustering/blob/main/clustering.ipynb)) notebook contains the sample code for running the clustering technique.
Before clustering, make sure your database is present in the data folder because the function requires the dataset name as input.
